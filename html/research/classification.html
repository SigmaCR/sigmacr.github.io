        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            The classification module of SigmaCR is responsible for identifying the product type at the first hand.
            When the product type of the product is identified from the classification module, the system can use
            that information to identify it's features in the context of that process using the ontology.
        </p>
        <p>
            The module will use the product reviews and some of the product specifications (if available) for the
            identification process. First the data will be preprocessed and then they will be forwaded to the
            classification process. Based on the results of the classification process and the confidence, the module
            will deside the next steps.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Module Architecture</h2>
        <p> Following diagram shows the architecture of the module.</p>
        <img src="../../img/research/classif_arch.png" alt="Classifier architecture"/>
        <br/>

        <h2>Classification Process</h2>
        <p>
            We will use WEKA tool for the core-classification. We will implement some of components to preprocess the
            data based on our requirements.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Evolving</h2>

        <p>
            As time goes on new products with new techologies emerges, and the system should be smart to evolve
            with those changes. For that we need to update our model continuesly so that it learns how to identify
            the newer products which are significantly different from the initial products. We will save the results of
            a product identification and use that data back (with the initial data) when
            building the next classification model.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            As discussed above the data is refeeded back to enhance the identification process. However this need to
            be handled with care. What if a product is mis-classified? The system will use that data in the next
            classification model version and mis-classify several more products. So the error might go increasing and
            will produce undesired and inaccurate results. And it also affects the other modules which are dependent
            on this.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid these kinds of situations, we will make sure that the confidence of the product identification
            is acceptable. Based on the confidence level we will make the following actions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Highly confident</b> -
                <p>
                    We are very much confident that the product belongs to the classified category. So will accept
                    the result and will queue it for training next model.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Moderately confident</b> -
                <p>
                    We are more than 50% confident that the product belongs to the classified category. But there
                    is another category which might accept the product with above 20% confidence. In this case we'll
                    use the classified category as the input for other modules, and at the same time will queue for
                    admin's confirmation. Once the admin confirms the result are correct the results will be queued
                    for training next model
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Less confident</b> -
                <p>
                    We have several categories which accepts this product with each having 20% - 50% confidence. We
                    will classify the product to "unknown" category in this case. And will do the steps for
                    moderately confidence level.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
