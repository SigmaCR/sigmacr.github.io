        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            The main feeds for the SigmaCR are customer reviews which are taken from different online e-commerce sites
            and the metadata of those reviews. As the first approach we have come up with an information retrieval
            system which collects the information (reviews and matadata) from well-known e-commerce site Amazon.com
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Getting customer reviews from Amazon.com</h3>

        <p> Basically there are two approaches possible.  </br></br>
            &nbsp&nbsp <b>1. Use Product Advertising API (web service) which is facilitated by the
                Amazon.com</b></b></br>
            &nbsp&nbsp <b>2. Traditional technique of information retrieval, Screen Scraping</b> </br></br>
            One important constrain we have to deal with when calling amazon web services, which they provide as Amazon
            Product Advertising API is that the responses from the webservices only contain URLs to the iframes. These
            Iframes contain the information which we requested for. As an example if we sent a request to their service
            indicating the requirement for the reviews for a particular product, the response only includes an Iframe
            link to the customer reviews iframe.
            This shows that at some point we have to use screen scraping techniques to get the reviews. Therefore we
            came up with a hybrid approach for the information retrieval system. </p>

        <br/>

        <h3>Calling the web service</h3>

        <p>
            The first part of the information retrieval system is implemented using JAVA. In order to get the free
            facilities given by the amazon AWS first the user have to sign up with amazon AWS using the link
            www.amazon.com and by following the on screen instructions.
            After signing up with their account you can request your credentials which are needed for accessing their
            services.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Screen Scraping with NodeJS</h2>

        <p>
            Considering the scenario in the project SigmaCR we had to come up with an efficient way to scrape content of
            the pages. There are number of network accesses and many file input output operations. Therefore it is
            necessary to have a non-blocking asynchronous architecture to deal with the efficiency and optimize the
            operations. NodeJS seems to be an interesting options for the requirements of the system SigmaCR.
        </p>

        <p>

        <ol>
            <li>Web development in a dynamic language (JavaScript) on a VM that is incredibly fast (V8). It is much
                faster than Ruby, Python, or Perl.
            </li>
            <li>Ability to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead on a single process.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is perfect for event loops with first class function objects and closures. People already
                know
                how to use it this way having used it in the browser to respond to user initiated events.
            </li>
            <li>A lot of people already know JavaScript, even people who do not claim to be programmers. It is arguably
                the most popular programming language
            </li>
            <li>Using JavaScript on a web server as well as the browser reduces the impedance mismatch between the two
                programming environments which can communicate data structures via JSON that work the same on both sides
                of
                the equation. Duplicate form validation code can be shared between server and client, etc.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>The architecture of the IR System</h2>

        <p>
            Basically Information Retrieval system comprises of two main components. The web services handler which is
            implemented using java and the screen scraping scripts which are implemented using NodeJS.
        </p>

        <p> Following diagram shows the architecture of the module.</p>
        <img src="../../img/research/retriver.jpeg" alt="Classifier architecture"/>
        <br/>

        <br/>

        <h2>Retrieving reviews for new search queries</h2>

        <p>
            Suppose the customer needs to analyze a new product which is not there in the system. For this kind of an
            approach the solution would be to get the search key and find out the relevant products in the e-commerce
            site and scrape reviews. The system SigmaCR basically do a search lookup using their product advertising
            API. From the responses we get, we order the products according to the number of reviews they include. Then
            the user is given the task to identify the relevant product.
        </p>

        <p>The main reason for this kind of approach is the ambiguity of the user search queries. Suppose you want to
            find or evaluate Samsung Galaxy S4 smart phone. The user will never type the whole phrase for the search
            query. Instead he/she will serach for “galaxy s4” , “Samsung galaxy s4” or even “s4”. Therefore the response
            results will include the pouches, cases and even stands for the phone Samsung galaxy s4. It is very
            difficult to intuitively guess what users are looking for. Therefore the best option is to let the user to
            decide what the exact product they want. When they specify one or two exact products, finding similar
            products can be taken cared by the information retrieval system. </p>

        <p>Once we identify the relevant products, the system will use those links to the products in order to retrieve
            reviews from the e-commerce site. Since this is the initial stage of getting reviews for the particular
            product the system will collect all reviews which are there in the product page with relevant metadata and
            other important information. Data which are retrieved include the following</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Customer Review</li>
            <li>Star rate of the review</li>
            <li>Author of the review</li>
            <li>Date accessed</li>
            <li>URL to the product page</li>
            <li>URL to the review page</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These reviews are stored in a hierarchical manner, so that it makes easier to access the reviews with
            metadata.
            The screen scraper which is implemented using NodeJS consists of a web spider which is complicated and page
            dependent. What spider does is, once the scraping is called by the Java program it goes to the product page
            and retrieve the page. It looks in the page and find out the number of pages which </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Updating Review Repository</h2>

        <p>Reviews are needed to be updated. The content of the pages changes with the time. Therefore in order to
            provide a timely aggregation, definitely we have to have an updated review set. The above system can be
            reused with few modifications to update the review repository</p>

        <p>When the system review repository needs to be updated simply the system will call the updating component
            which makes sure the reviews are up to date. What basically the updating components take care of is, when an
            update request come to a particular product, it simple reads the metadata of the relevant product directory
            and scrape the reviews which are posted after the last update. (the proposed approaches includes the process
            of getting relevant version of reviews directly from the web service)</p>
