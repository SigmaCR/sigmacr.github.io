        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            In SigmaCR, Sentiment Analysis is one of the major concentrations of the implementation and research part.
            SigmaCR does not limit its scope to find out whether a review is positive or negative. We have been doing
            experiments to find out how much positivity or negativity is embedded in a particular phrase of natural
            language. In order to do that, definitely we have to process natural language and come up with a mechanism
            to evaluate words in the language
        </p>

        <p>
            SentiWordNet [1] is a lexical resource for opinion mining. SentiWordNet assigns to each synset of WordNet
            [2] three sentiment numerical scores, positivity, negativity and objectivity, describing how Positive,
            Negative and Objective the terms contained in the synset are. Each of the three scores ranges from 0.0 to
            1.0, and their sum is 1.0 for each synset. This means that a synset may have nonzero scores for all the
            three categories, which would indicate that the corresponding terms have, in the sense indicated by the
            synset, each of the three opinion-related properties only to a certain degree. SentiWordNet word values have
            been semi-automatically computed based on the use the semi-supervised method described in [2].
        </p>

        <p> SentiWordNet is just a general purpose collection of adjectives with their relevant scores of positivity,
            negativity. Most of the applications of the SentiWordNet just pay the attention on the part of sentiment
            analysis. Ie they only consider about finding. But when it comes to our project context it is very important
            to have scientific background for these adjectives which implies how much positivity is included in a
            particular word.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>SentiWordNet based on star reviews of the customer reviews</h2>

        <p>The objective of this approach is experiment the positivity or the negativity of an adjective of a given in a
            review. One important aspect is that we do this experiment for customer reviews which are taken from real
            customers. Therefore the domain is fixed and it makes these scores more accurate for the given domain of
            customer reviews. This is one of the advantages of these scores over SentiWordNet Scores. For the project
            SigmaCR we have done an experiment over this idea using approximately 8500 customer reviews which are taken
            from amazon.com</p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Procedure</h4>

        <p>We need to get the Point of Speech tag of every token (words of the review) in reviews. To make the work
            efficient and more accurate we will be using morphological analyzer in order to get the root words of
            adjectives. For these two purposes we have used GATE, which is an application widely used for text
            processing.</p>

        <p>Step one for the process is reading the review, while reading, all the adjectives will be stored in a
            HashMap. The root of the adjective will
            be kept as the key of the HashMap and the value will comprise of number of fields such as occurrence count
            and the full score. (The score is not given directly from the star review value. The section Scoring using
            star reviews will describe different approaches we used)
            For each and every review get the adjectives increase the count of occurrence of that particular adjective.
            Add the relevant star review value to the full score. If the adjective is a new one which is not encountered
            before then it will be added to the HashMap.
            This procedure is carried out for all reviews. Finally for each adjective the full or total score is divided
            from the number of occurrences and find out an average score. These scores give a more sense about the
            meaning of the word. </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Scoring using star reviews</h2>

        <p>There are few different approaches we have used</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Approach 1</li>
            <p>Use the star rate as the score as it is. No modification is done to the star rate and the same value of
                the star rate is taken as the score of the particular occurrence of the adjective. This makes good
                results but the range of the scores is less since all the star reviews have a positive value between 0
                to 5. You can access the results from <a href="../../resources/sentiwordnet_results/result.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <li>Approach 2</li>
            <p>The second approach is more concentrated on stretching the score range for the adjectives. Therefore we
                came up with a scoring mechanism where some of the reviews are taken as reviews with negative star
                rating values. In this approach we consider reviews with less than a star rating of 3 is as a star rate
                with negative value. So the formula would be

                <b>
                    <ul>

                        <li type="square">If the star rate is greater or equal to 3 then score= star rate</li>
                        <li type="square"> If the star rate is less than 3 then score = negated star rate,</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br/>

                </b>
                With this approach, we were able to get more accurate and more interpretable results for scores of
                adjectives. You can access the results from <a href="../../resources/sentiwordnet_results/result_with_minus_less_than3.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Improvements to the extraction of sentiment words </h2>

        <p>In the above approach we just thought about extracting adjective by using POS tags. It would be an ideal
            approach if the review writers just use adjectives only. Ex- good will be counted as an adjective and the
            score will be added. Bad will be counted and the score will be added to the relevant key. Most probably the
            review with the word “good” will have a high star review and the review which contains “bad” will have a
            less star rate. Therefore it is ideal to aggregate those scores to total score and find the average. But
            what happens if the user has used “not good” instead of “bad”. Then the word good will be still extracted
            and the score with less magnitude will be added to the total score which results a drop down of the average
            value of the word “good”.</p>

        <p>Therefore we do need to concentrate on this and eliminate those negations and use only appropriate
            adjectives. For that we have used a grammar rules to eliminate negations and change the sign of star rate
            with negated words. This results in much improved results</p>
